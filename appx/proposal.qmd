**Project Proposal: Analyzing the Evolution of Men's Professional Tennis (2000-2023)**


**Team Members**: Dooley Kim, Kangyu Li


**Short Project Description**

This project aims to perform a comprehensive data analysis of the ATP Tour match results spanning over two decades (2000â€“2023). Using a rich dataset of match statistics, player attributes, and tournament details, we will explore key trends and changes in men's professional tennis. Our analysis will focus on how performance metrics have shifted, what factors contribute most significantly to match victory across different court surfaces, and the feasibility of building predictive models for match outcomes. The final deliverables will include a data report and a predictive model aimed at forecasting match winners.


**Research Questions** (2-3 Broad Questions)

Evolution of Performance by Surface: How have crucial match statistics (e.g., serve win percentage, break point conversion rate) evolved across different court surfaces (hard, clay, grass) between the pre-2010 era and the post-2010 era?
Key Predictors of Victory: What are the most significant statistical and contextual predictors (e.g., opponent's rank, player age, head-to-head history) of a match victory, and do these predictors vary between major tournaments (Grand Slams) and standard tour events?


**Reasons and Inspirations**

The inspiration for this project stems from a shared interest in sports analytics. The dataset provides a unique opportunity to study a long-term, high-quality athletic phenomenon. We aim to move beyond simple win-loss records to understand the underlying statistical mechanics that drive success in modern professional tennis, making the analysis relevant to both sports enthusiasts and data science practitioners.
